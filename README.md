# The brain-specific functional gene network in the BaiHui database

This brain-specific functional gene network was built by probabilistically integrating expertly-hand-curated (by reading original publications) heterogeneous genomics data. Details of this network are described in the following paper.<br>

Hong-Dong Li, Tianjian Bai, Erin Sandford, Margit Burmeister, Yuanfang Guan, BaiHui: cross-species brain-specific network built with hundreds of hand-curated datasets. Bioinformatics, 2019, 35, 2486â€“2488

The network is originally available at: http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BaiHui/. However, due to a server moving process, the website cannot be accessed currently. So, we now maintained a copy of the network here.<br>


As the full network is large with over 200 million edges between gene pairs. The network is splitted into multiple (n=60) small networks/files, which are available in the **network** folder for download.
